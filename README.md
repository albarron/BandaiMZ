# BandaiMZ
Home-made translation of the Bandai Mazinger Z 0159941 (2019) assembling instructions

This project includes scanned versions of only three of the pages of the user manual and instructions. These pages are enough to assemble the model.

The files can be opened with inkscape.

## Disclaimer
The translations were carried out with Google Translate, and after a lot of interpretation.
